Hello, I’m Marcin. I’m a programmer who enjoys thinking about how things work
and why they sometimes don’t. This site is a place where I write down thoughts
that feel worth keeping — technical ideas, observations, and occasional experiments.
Some entries are practical, some are reflective, all of them come from curiosity and tinkering.
There’s no strict theme or schedule here. Just a quiet corner of the internet where
I share things I find interesting.
