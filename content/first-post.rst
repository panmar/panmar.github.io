    fn main() {
        println!("Hello world!");
    }

This is my first post. Inspired by `Jakub Stasiak's blog <https://stasiak.at>`_
(which I highly recommend checking out), I've finally decided to start my
blogging adventure. To do so, I am using `Pelican <https://github.com/getpelican/pelican>`_,
and so far it's working wonderfully — I'm glad I resisted the temptation to roll my own solution.

For the theme, I’m using a modified version of `Jakub's theme <https://github.com/panmar/panmar.github.io>`_,
which I’ve been tweaking during late-night hours.
After some experimentation, I settled on a darker theme that feels easy on the eyes.
