    }

This is a first post. Inspired by a `Jakub Stasiak's blog <https://stasiak.at>`_
(I encourage you to visit it if you haven't already) I have finally decided to start my
blogging adventure. To do so I am using `Pelican <https://github.com/getpelican/pelican>`_.
So far it's working very nicely - I am glad I resisted the urge to roll my own solution.
I am using modified `Jakub's theme <https://github.com/panmar/panmar.github.io>`_, which
I've been tweaking during night hours - hence a dark theme.
