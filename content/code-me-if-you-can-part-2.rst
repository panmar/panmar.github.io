The second portion of ideas for programs to implement for fun during cold, winter nights.
The first part can be found `here <{filename}/code-me-if-you-can.rst>`_.

* CHIP-8 emulator
    * really good place to start when embarking on the emulator journey
    * only ~40 simple instructions to implement
    * well documented `design <http://devernay.free.fr/hacks/chip8/C8TECH10.HTM>`_
    * easily defined graphics (you can quickly visualize the progress!)
    * lots of `games <https://johnearnest.github.io/chip8Archive>`_ to test on
* Micromouse agent
    * inspired by `micromouse competition <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Micromouse>`_
    * write an agent to navigate a robot through a undiscovered maze
* Voxel engine
    * inspired by Teardown
    * use onlu cubes
    * use only procedural textures
* Online ascii editor
    * write an online ascii char editor similar to `asciiflow <https://asciiflow.com>`_, but much more intuitive
    * use webassembly
* Train a deep learning network how to play a 2d racing game
    * generate random cyclick track
    * implement simple 2d driving model
    * implement simple 2d sensor model
    * use deep learning to find quickest agent to complete the track
* Distributed data store
    * implement `CAS <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Content-addressable_storage>`_
* Create a custom programming language
    * design a simple programming language
    * implement a lexer
    * implement a recursive-descent parser
    * implement a LLVM backend
