Hello, I’m Martin. I’m a programmer who enjoys figuring out how things work
and why they sometimes don’t. This is a place where I write down my thoughts
— ideas, observations, and experiments.
Some entries are practical, some reflective, all born from curiosity and tinkering.
There’s no strict theme or schedule here. Just a quiet corner of the internet where
I share things I find interesting.
