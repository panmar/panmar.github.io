Some time ago, I started writing down ideas I could implement for fun. Here are a few projects to spend those long, autumn nights on:

* write a `Hack computer <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hack_computer>`_ emulator
    * inspired by a book `The Elements of Computing Systems: Building a Modern Computer from First Principles <https://www.amazon.com/Elements-Computing-Systems-Building-Principles/dp/0262640686>`_.
    * start from NAND gate
    * end with a simple game running on the system (Pong, Snake or Tetris)
* solve a maze by pouring liquid
    * implement simple 2d liquid physics
    * optimize, optimize, optimize
    * make simulation look nice
* implement an ultraprivate chat webapp
    * use end to end encryption
* implement a chess agent using less than 1024 tokens and maximum 256 MB of memory
    * inspired by `Sebastian Lague challange <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iScy18pVR58>`_
    * write a few agents and let them play
* implement a simple dlna server serving movies to TV
    * reverse-engineer existing solutions using wireshark
    * use as little documentation as possible
    * try not to read any source code
* write a raytracer using DXR
    * inspired by `Ray Tracing in One Weekend <https://raytracing.github.io>`_
* implement malloc
    * compare it with other popular implementations
