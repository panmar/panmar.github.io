<p>Hiring a good programmer is hard. Not “come up with clever LeetCode puzzles” hard — actually <em>figuring out how someone thinks</em> hard.</p>
<p>Over the years I’ve seen a few interview styles that really stuck with me. These aren’t about trick questions or whiteboard gymnastics. They’re about getting a glimpse into how someone approaches real problems. Here are three of my favourites:</p>
<div class="section" id="tell-me-about-your-project-and-i-ll-tell-you-who-you-are">
<h2>"Tell me about your project, and I'll tell you who you are..."</h2>
<p>In <a class="reference external" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cfyWvJdsDRI">this simulated interview</a>, Shawn McGrath walks Casey Muratori through his custom anti-aliasing implementation. Casey plays the role of a genuinely curious engineer and just keeps asking <em>why</em> and <em>how</em>.</p>
<p>What I like about this approach is how naturally it exposes depth. You can tell very quickly whether someone really understands the trade-offs they made, or if they just followed a tutorial and hoped for the best. Unlike toy algorithm problems, talking through a real project shows how a programmer thinks when things get messy—which is, let’s be honest, most of the job.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="found-this-bug-what-could-have-caused-it">
<h2>"Found this bug. What could have caused it?"</h2>
<p>Hussein Nasser talks about <a class="reference external" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bDIB2eIzIC8">his favorite interview question</a>, and it’s a great one. He starts by sketching out a system - database, backend, reverse proxy, load balancer, frontend—and then drops a concrete problem on the table. For example: <em>the UI freezes for about a minute after clicking a button</em>.</p>
<p>From there, the candidate is free to explore. How would you debug this? Where would you start? What do you suspect?</p>
<p>What’s clever here is that it’s completely open-ended. People naturally gravitate toward the parts of the system they understand best, and that tells you a lot. According to Hussein, he’s never gotten the same answer twice—and that tracks with my experience too.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="here-s-the-source-code-add-a-feature">
<h2>"Here's the source code. Add a feature..."</h2>
<p>In <a class="reference external" href="https://quuxplusone.github.io/blog/2022/01/06/memcached-interview/">this interview write-up</a>, the task is to add support for an atomic <strong>mult</strong> command to <a class="reference external" href="https://memcached.org">Memcached</a>.</p>
<p>I love this style because it’s unapologetically practical. You’re dropped into an unfamiliar codebase and asked to make a real change. No puzzles, no brainteasers - just: <em>can you read code, reason about it, and ship something without panicking?</em></p>
<p>This kind of exercise tends to surface pragmatic programmers - the ones who aren’t afraid to get their hands dirty, ask the right questions, and make progress even when everything isn’t perfectly documented.</p>
